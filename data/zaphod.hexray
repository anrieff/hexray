#
# A scene that imitates a page of a book ("The hitch-hiker's guide to the galaxy" for those of you who are curious),
# photographed from an angle with a dSLR with wide-aperture settings.
#
# The actual photograph was taken with a Canon 350D and 35mm F/2 at f/2, and at the closest focus, 24cm.
#
# In the scene here, the camera is located a bit higher than it was in the real shot; I'm just too tired to
# tweak it any more
